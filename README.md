# ng-picross

An AngularJS implementation of the puzzle game Picross, often terribly refered to as [nonograms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

## Running the server

`gulp serve`

## Running the tests

`gulp test`

`protractor protractor.conf.js`

## Deployment

`bin/deploy.sh`

Deploying builds the project and pushes to the `gh-pages` branch, after scrubbing all the commits so they're from "nobody@example.com". This is so nobody gets the magic github squares just for deploying.
